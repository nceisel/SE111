            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p>
                Building on the strenghts of the first film, with its unique ideas for its time, <em>Back to the Future Part II</em> keeps up the pace, this time jumping our cast forward from their time to 2015. The characters stuck to their tropes, making for an experience that enjoyers of the first part could relate with and call back to.

                The fantastical view of the future from that time period is always interesting to me. With flying cars and skateboards littering the streets of what is as of today (2022) 7 years ago, its interesting to see how times have changed, and how our expectations have aswell. Though I do think someday it would be nice to have a flying car...

            <h4>Trivia</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Michael J. Fox only found out there was to be a sequel after watching the VHS version and seeing the words "To be continued". He immediately contacted his agent to make sure he was going to be in the sequel.</li>
                <li>George McFly being dead in 1985-A (an alternate timeline), was based purely on Crispin Glovers refusal to do the sequel.</li>
                <li>The ledge of the clock tower broken by Doc in the first film is still broken in 2015</li>
            </ul>

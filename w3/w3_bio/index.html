                My name is <strong>Nathaniel Eisel</strong>. This is my second quarter at <b>NEIT</b>’s cyber security program. I’ve always had an interest in computer security, its elements, and computers themselves. Since I was young I’ve worked with them, my first computer being a 90’s era Compaq Armada laptop running Windows 98. When I was in high school, I participated in a computer security competition called <em>CyberPatriot</em>. Of the 4 teams the school oversaw, my team was on top all 4 years. This combined with an incident where I found a flaw in the school's internet security got me known as <i>The Computer Guy</i>. I do my best to both work and study, working as a builder for a Rhode Island based custom upholstery manufacturer. I always seek to improve my current skill set, and I believe that <b>NEIT</b> is the perfect place to do so.

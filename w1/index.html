        <h1>Nathaniel Eisel</h1>
        <p>My name is <b>Nathaniel Eisel</b>. This is my second quarter at NEIT’s cyber security program. I’ve always had an interest in computer security, its elements, and computers themselves. Since I was young I’ve worked with them, my first computer being a 90’s era Compaq Armada laptop running Windows 98. When I was in high school, I participated in a computer security competition called <i>CyberPatriot</i>. Of the 4 teams the school oversaw, my team was on top <u>all 4 years</u>. This combined with an incident where I found a flaw in the school's internet security got me known as <i>The Computer Guy</i>. Despite my skills with computers, however, I always seek to improve my current skill set, and I believe that NEIT is the perfect place to do so.</p>
